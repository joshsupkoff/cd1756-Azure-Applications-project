*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

ANSWER:
A VM would be the ideal choice if the customer wants more leash on the management of their systems. A VM allows the user to configre the OS. A web app, on the other hand, is hosted on a server not managed by the customer. A web app would be the better choice if the user was less concerned over the OS configuration, etc. and more concerned about accesbility. Let's say the customer in this instance is more concerned with the web app functioning ans scaling well, and does not currently have a need to be picky about the config and the OS of the underlying infrastructure. In this case, a web app would be the better approach.
